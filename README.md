Learning Recommendation System 📚🤖

An end-to-end learning recommendation system that suggests the next relevant courses
to learners based on historical interaction data from a MOOC platform.

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline from raw interaction logs and feature engineering
to sequence-based modeling, hybrid recommendation strategies, and deployment using Streamlit.
