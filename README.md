📚 Learning Recommendation System (MOOC – XuetangX)

An end-to-end learning recommendation system that suggests the next relevant courses to learners based on historical interaction data.

Built as part of Challenge 3: Learning Recommendation System, this project covers the complete pipeline from data preprocessing and modeling to deployment using Streamlit.

🚀 Project Overview

Online learning platforms generate rich user interaction data. This project leverages that data to:

Recommend next learning items (courses)

Handle cold-start users

Model temporal learning behavior

Evaluate using ranking-based metrics

Demonstrate results via a web application

Implemented Approaches

Most Popular baseline

Collaborative Filtering (ALS)

Sequence-based model (GRU4Rec-style)

Hybrid recommendation strategy

Candidate generation + ranking pipeline
